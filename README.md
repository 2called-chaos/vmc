# MCIR - MineCraftInitRuby ehhh... thingy :)

MCIR is a little CLI framework to make the administration of one or multiple Minecraft servers easier.
There are some build-in tasks to get you started (and to legitimate the "init" part of the name) but it isn't that hard to build your own especially if you're familiar with the Ruby programming language ;)

Just take a look at the examples, they should give you a little insight of what is possible (look at the restart task).
There isn't that much documentation yet, sorry *._.*

## What it does (provide)

  * A simple task based framework to build simple managing commands for your minecraft server(s).
  * Simple, non-invasive structure.
  * Default and example tasks to manage your server(s) and get started with building your own.

## What it (currently) doesn't (provide)

  * Multi user support (all instances need to run under the same user as MCIR)
  * Multi machine support (only manages instances on the same machine)

## Requirements
  - Ruby >= 1.9.3 incl. RubyGems
    - Bundler gem (`gem install bundler`)
  - git (`apt-get install git` / `brew install git`)
  - Unixoid OS (such as Ubuntu/Debian, OS X, maybe others)
  - screen command installed (`apt-get install screen`)
  - local minecraft server(s) (minecraft, bukkit, whatever)

## Setup
  0. Do everything as the user which runs the servers except maybe the symlink in step 2.
  1. Download or clone the whole thing to where you're servers are:
      <pre>
        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/2called-chaos/MCIR.git</pre>
  2. Optional but recommended: Add the bin directory to your $PATH variable or create a symlink to the executable:
      <pre>
        echo 'export PATH="$HOME/MCIR/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
        OR
        ln -s /home/minecraft_server/MCIR/bin/mcir /usr/local/bin/mcir</pre>
  3. Install the bundle
      <pre>
        cd ~/MCIR && bundle install --without test --deployment</pre>
  4. Copy and edit the example configuration to fit your needs and server settings.
     Please note that there is currently no user support which means all servers need to run under the same user as MCIR does.
      <pre>
        cd ~/MCIR
        cp config.example.yml config.yml
        nano config.yml</pre>
  5. Dig right into it! Run `mcir --help` to get a list of default options and available actions.
     Run `mcir <action> --help` to get a list of all the action specific options.

## Add custom action
To add your own custom action you have two options.

If you just need a quick and simple command open the file `/home/minecraft_server/MCIR/mcir.rb` and take a look at the examples.
Otherwise take a look into the directory `/home/minecraft_server/MCIR/actions`. All default actions are there so you should have some examples to work with. All .rb files in this directory and it's subdirectories are automatically loaded.
